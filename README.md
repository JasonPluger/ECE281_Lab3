###Analysis


Functionality: Got my Moore Elevator Controller checked off by Dr. Neebel on 13 March 14 at 1428 - basic functionality.

Documentation: Prelab: C3C ElSawaay explained his schematic to me, which made it click that each "component" statement in the Nexsys2 top shell module corresponds to a module inside the top shell. Pictorially, this is the same as having a box that does something inside a bigger box.
